# FullAdder-Binary-Circuit-Simulator
  ICS 102/183 PROJECT

* About the project:
  Simulate the operation of a n-bit binary adder and subtractor using 
  full adder circuit to add/subtract two positive integer numbers. 
  
* About the source code folder:
  1. SimulatorProject.java - contains the main method.
  2. IntAdder.java - addition is executed.
  3. Subtractor.java - subtraction is executed using IntAdder class.
  4. FullAdder.java - bitwise operation of full adder circuit is executed.
  5. BinOperations.java - all the logical operations using logic gates are executed.
